Robots From Mars

I started working on the challenge in an exploratory mind set creating tests for the grid. I used an Outside In approach to TDD. My testing then moved down to the robot tests and then the build out of the Instruction functionality. I spent time here so that the robot could extend the functionality of the instruction interface.

I then moved on to the creation of the Instructions, I then created unit tests for each of the instructions.

Finally I created tests for moving a robot across the grid

Unfinished steps:

I unfortunately ran out of time so was not able to complete some of the steps, there were Lost robots and The additional input.

I also would have liked to have created an additional abstraction layer around the robots and grids
